📰 Fake News Detection on Social Media using Supervised Learning
This project focuses on detecting fake news circulating on social media platforms using supervised machine learning techniques. With the increasing spread of misinformation online, especially on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, automatic detection of fake news has become essential.

🔍 Objective
The main objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify a news article as real or fake based on its content. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

📑 Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing of text data (removal of noise, stop words, punctuation, etc.)

Text vectorization using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer

Supervised learning models trained to distinguish between fake and real news

Performance evaluation using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization tools like confusion matrix and ROC curves to understand model behavior

Option to deploy the model as a simple web application

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms
Several supervised learning algorithms are explored in this project, including:

Logistic Regression

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree and Random Forest (optional)

📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled news articles categorized as real or fake. Commonly used datasets include publicly available collections from platforms like Kaggle or academic sources such as the LIAR dataset. These datasets contain headlines, article bodies, and labels indicating authenticity.

📈 Project Outcomes
The project achieves high classification accuracy by effectively learning from text patterns in the news articles. Among the algorithms used, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performed particularly well in terms of both speed and accuracy.

📁 Project Structure
The project is organized in a modular format with separate folders for datasets, models, and notebooks. Each part of the pipeline—preprocessing, training, evaluation—is documented and organized for clarity and reproducibility.
